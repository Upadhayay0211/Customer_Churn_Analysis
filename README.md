# Customer Churn Analysis 📊

## Overview
This project digs into why customers leave — looking at contracts, payment methods, tenure, internet service, and demographics. The goal: spot patterns and suggest smart ways to keep customers around.

## Key Findings
- **Contracts**: Month-to-month churns the most (42%), while 2‑year contracts are super sticky (3%).
- **Payments**: Electronic check users churn at 45% vs. ~15% for other methods.
- **Tenure**: First‑year customers churn at 50%, but loyalty grows over time.
- **Internet Service**: Fiber users churn more (30%) than DSL (20%).
- **Senior Citizens**: Higher churn (41%) compared to non‑seniors (26%).

## Recommendations
- Encourage **long‑term contracts** with perks.
- Shift customers away from **electronic checks**.
- Double down on **early engagement** (first year matters most).
- Create **senior‑friendly programs** for better retention.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (MySQL/SQLite)
- Power BI / Tableau for dashboards
